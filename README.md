# Convolution-Coding-Software
A software for simulating transmission of convolution codes was made in MATLAB that first encoded the given message, passed it through noisy BEC, BSC and AWGN channels and decoded the received bits at the receiver using BCJR and Viterbi Algorithm(Dynamic Programming + Trellis Traceback). Monte Carlo Simulations were used to determine accuracy of the decoder implemented.
